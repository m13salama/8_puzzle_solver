# 8_puzzle_solver
Hi my friend this is our 8 puzzle game enjoy it.\
The 8 puzzle consists of eight numbered, movable tiles set in a 3x3 frame. One cell of the frame is always empty thus making it possible to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell.\
the goal is to rearrange the tiles.\
our goal was to make an AI agent to solve it so we implemented this agent using 3 algorithms(DFS,BFS,A*)...try them all and see the difference by youerself.

## Tech Stack: 
* GUI: PyGame
* Logic: python

## Features:
* two modes: playing/solving.
* 3 searcing algorithms.
*  time & no. of moves analysis.
